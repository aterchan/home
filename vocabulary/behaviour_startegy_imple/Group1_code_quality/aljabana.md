# code quality
--- 
Code quality defines code that is good (high quality) — and code that is bad (low quality).

## Why Code Quality Matters
The code quality is important, as it impacts the overall software quality. And quality impacts how safe, secure, and reliable your codebase is.

## How to Measure Code Quality?
There’s no one way to measure the quality of your code. What you measure may be different from what other development team measures.

### Key Code Quality Aspects to Measure
* Reliability


Reliability measures the probability that a system will run without failure over a specific period of operation. It relates to the number of defects and availability of the software.
* Maintainability

Maintainability measures how easily software can be maintained. It relates to the size, consistency, structure, and complexity of the codebase. And ensuring maintainable source code relies on a number of factors, such as testability and understandability.
  
  * Testability

Testability measures how well the software supports testing efforts. It relies on how well you can control, observe, isolate, and automate testing, among other factors.

* Portability

Portability measures how usable the same software is in different environments. It relates to platform independency.

* Reusability

Reusability measures whether existing assets — such as code — can be used again. Assets are more easily reused if they have characteristics such as modularity or loose coupling.

## Why programmers prefer using spaces than tabs.
* There are a number of programmers out there that use indentation in their code rather than tabs. ... Not only is this technique more visually appealing, it allows programmers to make more money.
